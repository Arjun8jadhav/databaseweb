       <p>A database management system (DBMS) refers to the technology for creating and managing databases.Basically DBMS is a software tool to organize (create, retrieve, updateand manage) data in a database. The main aim of a DBMS is to supply a way to store up and retrieve databaseinformation that is both convenient and efficient. By data, we mean known facts that can be recorded and that have embedded meaning. Normally people use software such asDBASE IV or V, Microsoft ACCESS, or EXCEL to store data in the form of database.Database systems are meant to handle large collection of information. Managementof data involves both defining structures for storage of information and providingmechanisms that can do the manipulation of those stored information. Moreover, thedatabase system must ensure the safety of the information stored, despite system crashes orattempts at unauthorized access</p>
       <p>This project is aim at computerizing the manual process of login system, here we have used pythons Django framework for building website and managing its backend . To manage database and also to authorize users authenticity we have used MYSQL database, Firstly here user have to create its ID with its First name, last name email id and password
       &nbsp; Then once we created account we have to visit login page, here we should put our necessary informationinorder to access our Website . if our input is right then it will let us access our Web if its wrong then it will redirect us on ERROR page</p>
